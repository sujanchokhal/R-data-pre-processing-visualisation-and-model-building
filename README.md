# R-data-pre-processing-visualisation-and-model-building
This report represents the analysis of Articles dataset on the basis of topic modeling. The major objective of report is to establish data wrangling, visualization, model development, evaluation and the effective communication of insights. The articles have been analyzed on the basis of topic modeling for text mining in R.

 
The objective of this report is to analyzing articles are as follows:
•	Content summarization:  there are lots of articles in the dataset, and this report will extract the most representative topics.
•	Information retrieval: it can be used to searching for document based on topics which will help on search engines and content recommendation system.

•	Content understanding: This analysis will help to understanding the subject matter into targeted analysis.
Overall, the major objective is to extracting meaningful insights from the article textual data.

Tools and technologies 
R program language has been using of open-source environment for data analysis. Specially, TM (text mining) and (topicmodels) packages are used for preprocessing text data. And for visualization tidyverese has been used. Whereas, dplyr , tidyr and ggplot2. The reason to choose R is, it has lots of advantages for topic modeling analysis and it can fit into our goals of article analysis.
